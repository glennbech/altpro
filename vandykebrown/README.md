# Van Dyke Brown process

### Exposure

Trial and error! expose until you think it's over exposed. It will lighten up in the along the process

#### My Sun tanning unit

7 Minutes, not pre-heated as a baseline, adjust negatives to fit. This is because this exposure produces maximum black
through the transparency (Pictorico)


### Tray 1: First Wash-Development
1. Perform the first wash-development in **distilled water** for **5 minutes**.
    - Use a pinch of citric acid
    - Tap water can also be used, but I have access to unlimited destilled so... 

### Tray 2: Second Wash-Development
1. Wash-develop in running water for an additional **1-2 minutes**.

### Tray 3: Fixing Bath
1. Prepare a **3% sodium thiosulphate fixing bath** by mixing:
    - **30 g of sodium thiosulphate**,
    - **2 g of sodium carbonate** (an alkali)
    - **1,000 ml of water**.

### Tray 4: Optional Clearing Bath - to rinse fixer better
1. You can make an optional **sodium sulphite fixer clearing bath** by mixing:
    - **10 g of sodium sulphite** with **1,000 ml of water**.
    - The reason for this step is to better clear the paper of the fixer 

### Tray 5: Final Wash
1. Perform a final wash, which will last **20-30 minutes**.
   - Put the paper in a large tray with tap water, let it rest and replace water 2-3 times.
