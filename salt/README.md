# Salt print process

This is a description of my current salt print process. It is important to stay with the same process version through an entire print cycle. One print must always be completed with one specific version of this process.

## Paper Selection for this process

Bergger Cot 320gsm

## Paper preparation

* If not done, create a Tag for this repository in the format yyyy-mm-dd-nn
* Write this process version on the paper
* Write the paper type on the paper with a pencil
* Write intended paper salting option (NaCl etc) on the paper with a pencil
* Write the current date on the paper

### NaCL Option

* 20 g Salt
* 1000 ml water (Destilled)

Soak papers by immersion and sort through the stack a couple of times. Soak time; 1 Hour
Reference: Christina Zanderson.

### Sodium Citrate & Ammonion Chloride Option

Prepare a solution of the following into tap water

* 20g Ammonium Chloride
* 20g Sodium Citrate
* Water 1000 ml

### Paper drying

* Hang overnight
* Press between two glass sheets to even out any curving, possibly also over overnight

### Sensitizer

* 15% Silver nitrate solution
* Apply 1,2 ml / 100 cm2 of paper

### Post sensitizer paper drying

* Natural drying, or -
* Forced by room temperature airflow 15 minutes

## Exposure

The expoure is normalized at 40millivolts pr/sqm. Exposure time with my Phillips UVA Facial tanner is 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the unit has constant output
* Expose for the given time

## Processing

The print is processed in trays after exposure

### 5% salt wash

* Constant agitation 4 minutes. Water needs to be changed between a couple of prints
, so make more 5% salt solution than needed.

### Tap Water Wash #1

* Wash 4 minutes. Some agitation

### Tap Water Wash #2

* Wash 4 minutes. Some agitation. Swap Wash #2 water for Wash #1 water from time to time and replenish Wash #2.

### Toner

* To be decided later.

### Fixing in Alkaline fixer

* 150g Sodium Thiosulphate
* 2g Sodium Carbonate (Washing soda)
* Water 1000ml

### Hyopclear (optional)

* Recommended, but prefer longer wash time at the moment
