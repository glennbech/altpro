# Salt print process

This is a description of my current salt print process. It is important to stay with the same process version through an entire print cycle. One print must always be completed with one specific version of this process.

## Paper Selection for this process

Bergger Cot 320gsm

## Paper preparation

* If not done, create a Tag for this repository in the format yyyy-mm-dd-nn
* Write this process version on the paper
* Write the paper type on the paper with a pencil
* Write the paper salting option you plan to use (NaCl etc) on the paper with a pencil
* Write the toner and toning time you plan to use on the paper. 
* Write the current date on the paper

### NaCL Option

* 20 g Salt
